	                    Why Med.Space?
	                </h3>
	                <p>
	                    Each year, more than 36 million deaths are caused by medical errors, across the world, that is around 10% of the total deaths due to medical reasons. A large chunk of it is caused because the doctor(s) handling the patient gets confused and feel stuck, and really have no clue on what should be done or how. Neither is there a community for them. That's what MedSpace aims to solve. It gives doctors a safe and trusted platform where they can ask doubts, talk with fellow doctors, and so can answer doubts of other doctors.

	                <p>
	                    A doctor from anywhere in the world needs to sign up, and then login for future sessions. Then, they can see a feed of the latest questions and answers. They can find relevant questions using the search bar. They can answer the questions as well. Also, if there's no question that matches their concern, they can create a new question. Moreover, there's a News screen for all the latest news related to health and also in general as well. Weâ€™ve also included a dark theme toggle for better accessibility.

	                    How Did We Build It?
	                </h3>
	                <p>
	                    For the front end of the main application we used Flutter and for the back end, we used Express.js which is a part of Node.js,Typescript and mongoDB for the database. Simple endpoints were created to login, registration and feed page, and a database was created that holds a user's information such as name, country, medical license number, age, location of work, speciality of work, ect. We also used HTML and CSS to create a simple static web page that provides details about the project and leads to github where you are able to run a demo or check out the Flutter apk.

	                    Challenges We Ran Into
	                </h3>
	                <p>
	                    One challenge for our team was working on the hack at different time zones as we are spread around the globe. Another main challenge we ran into is the use of unfamiliar technologies. Some of the members were new to Flutter or Typescript, so we had to read documentation and articles during the hackathon to fully understand the code and logic of what everyone was doing.

	                    Accomplishmnts We Are Proud Of
	                </h3>
	                <p>
	                    There are a couple of things that we are proud of. One of them is that eventually we were all able to work together and understand what everyone was doing despite the time zone difference. We are also proud of the fact that throughout the project we were able to learn and implement new technologies such as mongodb Atlas and Flutter, that we did not know before the hackathon started. One important accomplishment is that we were able to overcome a huge time constraint and come up with a prototype of an idea that has potential to change people's lives.

	                </h3>
	                <p>
	                    Throughout the hackathon we were all able to learn a bit about the technologies the other members were using for their part. For some of us, it was the first time using Flutter, while for others it was the first time using MondgoDB and typescript/node.js/express.js.

	                </h3>
	                <p>
	                    For next steps on Med.Space, we would like to add a private messaging feature, where any medical professional can talk to another professional and expand their network. We can also add a more secure authentication process where we are able to check the medical license number with different countries and check if all the details provided match with the countries records.
